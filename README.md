# Yet Another VIPER Implementation

Works with and without Rx.

## Usage
1. Copy files from `Base` folder to project if needed.
2. Install VIPER template: 
    ```
    sh install.sh
    ```
3. Create new VIPER module: select `New File -> VIPER` in an empty group.
4. Resolve TODOs and customize module.

### Caveats
OS X could block attempts to run `./install.sh` as a suspicious script from the internet. Please run via `sh`.
